# Contributing

Thank you for contributing. Keep changes focused, tested, signed off,
and documented. Participation in this project is governed by the
[project conduct expectations](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Setup

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uvx pre-commit install
```

The pre-commit hook runs the same ruff/ty checks as CI. Installing it
shortens the local feedback loop; CI remains the final gate.

`kaos-tabular` requires Python 3.13 or newer. It publishes the `kaos_tabular`
import package. This package publishes CLI entry point(s): `kaos-tabular`, `kaos-tabular-serve`.
Public extras currently declared: `mcp`.


## Before Opening A PR

Run the local quality gate:

```bash
uv run ruff format --check kaos_tabular tests
uv run ruff check kaos_tabular tests
uv run ty check --exclude kaos_tabular/serve.py kaos_tabular tests
uv run pytest tests/unit -m "not benchmark" --no-cov
```

`kaos_tabular/serve.py` imports the optional MCP extra. Type-check it with
the `dev-mcp` group on Python versions where the MCP dependency chain has
compatible wheels.

When packaging, metadata, README rendering, or release behavior changes,
also run:

```bash
uv build
uvx --from twine twine check --strict dist/*
```

Type checking uses `ty`, not mypy. Inline ignores use
`# ty: ignore[...]`; `# type: ignore[...]` is mypy syntax and is not a
substitute for a `ty` ignore.

## Standards

Read the standards before making non-trivial changes:

- [Python design and architecture](docs/standards/python-design-and-architecture.md)
- [Code quality standards](docs/standards/code-quality-standards.md)
- [Engineering process](docs/standards/engineering-process.md)
- [Tests, fixtures, and CI](docs/standards/tests-fixtures-ci.md)

## Pull Requests

Pull requests should explain:

- what changed
- why it changed
- how it was tested
- whether public API, CLI behavior, package metadata, fixtures, or
  release artifacts changed
- whether `CHANGELOG.md` needs an `[Unreleased]` entry

Bug fixes need regression tests. User-visible behavior changes need docs
and a CHANGELOG entry under `[Unreleased]`.

Before requesting review, confirm:

- [ ] One logical change per PR.
- [ ] Branch rebased on `main`.
- [ ] Tests added or updated when behavior changes.
- [ ] Local quality gate run.
- [ ] Public API, CLI, package metadata, fixtures, and release impact
      considered.
- [ ] DCO sign-off on every commit (`git commit -s`).

## Testing Standards

- New public API needs a test through its real entry point.
- Mocked-only tests are not enough for security-sensitive behavior.
- Security-sensitive behavior must test both accepted and rejected cases
  with realistic inputs.
- Fixtures must be redistributable and documented.

## Issues

Open issues using the templates in
[`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/). Bug reports should
include the `kaos-tabular` version, Python version, operating system,
installation method, installed extras, a minimal reproducer, expected
behavior, and actual behavior.

Do not file public issues for security reports. Follow
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead.

## Commits

Use conventional commit style and sign commits with `git commit -s` for
the Developer Certificate of Origin:

```text
feat: add new capability
fix: correct broken behavior
docs: update examples
ci: adjust workflow
chore: refresh tooling
```

## Changelog

Update `CHANGELOG.md` for user-visible changes, including public API,
CLI behavior, schema output, package metadata, security behavior, and
deprecations.

## Security

Do not report suspected vulnerabilities in public issues. Follow
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
