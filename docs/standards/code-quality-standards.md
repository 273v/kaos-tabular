# Code Quality Standards

These standards define the minimum quality bar for `kaos-tabular` changes.

## Baseline Tools

`kaos-tabular` uses:

- `uv` for environments, dependency resolution, builds, and publishing
  commands.
- `ruff format` for formatting.
- `ruff check` for linting.
- `ty check` for type checking.
- `pytest` for tests.
- `twine check --strict` for built distribution metadata checks.

This package is pure Python. Rust, PyO3, `maturin`, and Cargo checks are not part of its active quality gate.

## Formatting

- Formatting is automated and non-negotiable.
- Do not mix style-only rewrites with behavior changes.
- Keep generated files out of hand-edited diffs unless the generation
  step is part of the change.
- Avoid broad reformatting of files unrelated to the PR.

Local format check:

```bash
uv run ruff format --check kaos_tabular tests
```

## Linting

- Lint cleanly before review.
- Do not silence a lint rule without a local reason.
- Prefer targeted ignores over file-wide ignores.
- Delete unused code instead of hiding it.
- Keep imports ordered and explicit.

Local lint check:

```bash
uv run ruff check kaos_tabular tests
```

## Typing

- Public functions and methods must be typed.
- Complex internal functions should be typed.
- Avoid `Any` unless the boundary is genuinely dynamic.
- Use `typing.Protocol` for structural extension points.
- Use `Literal`, `TypedDict`, dataclasses, or Pydantic models where they
  make external contracts clearer.
- Use `# ty: ignore[...]` only with the narrowest possible rule and a
  reason when the reason is not obvious.

Local type check:

```bash
uv run ty check kaos_tabular tests
```

## Tests

- Bug fixes require regression tests.
- New public behavior requires tests at the right tier.
- Test names should describe behavior, not implementation.
- Prefer semantic assertions over "not empty" assertions.
- Avoid brittle snapshots for large payloads unless they are golden
  fixtures with a review process.
- Do not use network or live credentials in unit tests.

Local unit and integration gate:

```bash
uv run pytest -m "not live and not network and not slow" --no-cov
```

## Public API Discipline

- Public API changes need changelog entries.
- Avoid broad re-exports that make internals public accidentally.
- Deprecate before removal when the stability policy requires it.
- Keep CLI, MCP, JSON, schema, and env-var contracts stable once
  released.
- Do not rename public objects for aesthetics in patch releases.

## Security Standards

- Never commit secrets, tokens, private keys, credentials, or `.env`
  files.
- Use secret-aware types for credentials where available.
- Redact secrets in logs, CLI output, JSON output, and errors.
- Add limits for untrusted input.
- Preserve security checks around paths, URLs, archives, credentials,
  subprocesses, external services, and artifact handling.
- Do not add GPL, AGPL, unknown-license, non-commercial, or
  no-derivatives dependencies.
- Run secret scanning before release.

## Dependency Hygiene

- Keep base dependencies minimal.
- Put integrations behind extras.
- Pin lower bounds intentionally and test them when possible.
- Do not rely on undeclared transitive dependencies.
- Prefer well-maintained packages with compatible licenses.
- Document risky or unusual dependencies.

## Documentation Quality

- README examples must run.
- Public functions with non-obvious behavior need docstrings.
- CLI flags and JSON output must be documented.
- Error messages should be useful without reading source.
- Keep docs current with code in the same PR.

## Performance Quality

- Do not optimize without a measurement for non-trivial changes.
- Add or update benchmarks for performance-sensitive APIs.
- Watch memory growth on large inputs.
- Bound expensive operations.
- Preserve streaming behavior where it is part of the design.

## Definition Of Done

A change is done when:

- The implementation is complete and scoped to the stated problem.
- Tests cover the new or changed behavior.
- Formatting, linting, typing, and tests pass.
- Built distributions pass strict metadata checks when packaging is
  affected.
- Security and dependency checks pass when relevant.
- README, docs, and CHANGELOG are updated when public behavior changes.
- The PR explains what changed, why, and how it was verified.
